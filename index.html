It just depends on the person and what they are able to do and how much they can work on learnind code.</p>

    <p class="p_footer">The Computer Science degree takes around 4 years and teaces you about full stack Development. Front-end is the visual parts of code(Like this website) Back-End is the working parts, the parts that tell the computer what to do. FullStack is both front-end and back-end. Taking the College isn't must as you can do the self-taught way and still get the same job as the person who did the degree.</p>
